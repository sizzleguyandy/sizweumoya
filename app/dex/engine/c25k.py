C25K Engine — Couch to 5K program.

Completely separate from the phase-based system. No VO2X, no volume curves,
no phases. Rejoins the main system only at the transition point (week 12 → full plan).

Schedule: 12 weeks × 3 sessions/week (Mon/Wed/Fri).
Pacing: conversational effort only — no pace zones prescribed.
