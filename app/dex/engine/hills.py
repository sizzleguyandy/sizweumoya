"""
Hill work engine.

Determines whether a quality session should be replaced with hill work,
and prescribes the appropriate hill workout based on:
    - race_hilliness: "low" | "medium" | "high"
    - phase:          1 | 2 | 3 | 4

Replacement matrix (from spec):
    Phase I   → never replaced (strides already hill-like)
    Phase II  → medium: 50% sessions; high: 100%
    Phase III → medium: 50% sessions; high: 100%
    Phase IV  → no replacement, but high adds downhill/terrain to long run

"50% replacement" is implemented by alternating weeks:
    odd week numbers within the phase → hill workout
    even week numbers within the phase → standard flat workout
